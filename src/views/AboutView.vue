            First of All,by the grace of Allah,I have become able to create this website to make Al-Qur'an available to all the people in online. Actually,I used An API which is developed by some great developers and i also take the idea of FrontEnd of this website from Quran.com . Thanks to Quran.com's developers to give us a great API and cool Quran website.
